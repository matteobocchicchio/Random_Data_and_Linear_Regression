# Statistical Analysis and Linear Regression – Excel Project

This Excel-based project applies statistical analysis techniques to sample data. It includes parameter generation, correlation testing, and linear regression modeling using Excel formulas and functions.

## File Overview

### 1. Parameters
- Random value generation using RAND()
- Defines population mean and standard deviation

### 2. Data
- Sample dataset with age and ID values used for group analysis

### 3. Samples
- Grouped records based on sample categories
- Includes subgrouped values for additional segmentation

### 4. Statistical Insight
- Summary statistics:
  - Standard deviation, expected value, confidence rate
  - Estimation of population parameters (mean, variance, standard error)
  - Confidence intervals

### 5. (Un)correlated Variables
- Correlation tests between:
  - Age and number of cats
  - Age and partner’s age
- Includes covariance, Pearson coefficient, and p-value
- Manual explanation of the formulas used

### 6. Linear Regression
- Basic regression analysis between age and rank
- Simulated rank values and forecast calculations
- Explanation of the formula used for predicting values (e.g., for rank 160)

## Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel (functions such as RAND(), CORREL(), COVARIANCE(), basic regression)

## Project Goal

To explore core statistical methods and linear regression within a spreadsheet environment. The project helps build understanding of relationships between variables and how predictions can be modeled from sample data.

## Notes

This is a fully self-contained Excel project. All transformations and calculations are done using built-in Excel formulas without the use of external tools or programming.
